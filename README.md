## Why NeuralReaper

Most "AI + security" demos wire a chatbot up to a single API and call it a day. NeuralReaper instead gives Claude **direct, sandboxed execution access** to a real offensive security toolchain — the same binaries a human pentester would run from a terminal — through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

The result: you describe an objective in plain English, and Claude plans and executes the actual recon — choosing tools, chaining scans, and reasoning over real output — instead of guessing from training data.

What makes it worth putting on a resume rather than just a script:

- **A live, auto-updating CVE engine.** [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) ships 12,000+ community templates and is updated continuously, so the scanner isn't frozen at whatever existed when the image was built.
- **Isolated by design.** Every tool runs inside a locked-down, non-root Ubuntu container — never on the host.
- **A real engineering trail.** Built across Windows + WSL2 + Docker Desktop + Claude Desktop, hitting (and solving) the exact integration failures documented below instead of glossing over them.
- **Breadth across the full modern assessment surface** — network/web recon, Active Directory attack-path enumeration, cryptographic/post-quantum posture, supply-chain dependency auditing, and local fuzzing — not just a wrapper around one scanner.

---

## Design Philosophy — Detection, Not Weaponization

Comparable AI-agent pentest frameworks exist, and some — most notably [HexStrike AI](https://hexstrike.com/) — ship an automated exploit-generation layer on top of recon/scanning. Within hours of HexStrike's public release, researchers observed threat actors discussing how to weaponize it against a Citrix NetScaler zero-day (CVE-2025-7775), compressing what used to take days of manual exploit development into roughly 10 minutes.

NeuralReaper deliberately stops one step earlier. Every tool here identifies, enumerates, and reports — it does not generate exploit payloads, and it never will. The CVE watchlist is lookup-only: it calls existing Nuclei templates and ExploitDB entries for matches, writing zero new detection or exploitation logic of its own.

That's a constraint, not a missing feature — and worth saying explicitly: building security tooling with an eye on how it could be misused is itself a skill.
---

## Architecture

<img src="docs/neuralreaper_v2_architecture.png" alt="NeuralReaper v2.0 Architecture" width="100%"/>
```

Claude Desktop spawns the container per-session over stdio — there is no persistent network listener, no exposed port, and no state retained between runs beyond what Docker itself caches (e.g. Nuclei's template directory) and the in-memory session log used by `generate_report()`.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-artist111/NeuralReaper.git
cd NeuralReaper
docker build -t neuralreaper:latest .
```

Point Claude Desktop at it by merging `claude_desktop_config.json` into your own config, then restart Claude Desktop. Full instructions below.

---

## Detailed Setup

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-artist111/NeuralReaper.git
cd NeuralReaper
docker build -t neuralreaper:latest .

mkdir -p ~/.config/Claude
cp claude_desktop_config.json ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
# restart Claude Desktop
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows via WSL2 (recommended on Windows)</strong></summary>

1. Install **Docker Desktop** for Windows.
2. In Docker Desktop → **Settings → Resources → WSL Integration**, enable your distro (e.g. Ubuntu) and **Apply & Restart**.
3. Inside your WSL2 distro:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/the-artist111/NeuralReaper.git
   cd NeuralReaper
   docker build -t neuralreaper:latest .
   ```
4. Copy the config to Windows (run from PowerShell, **not** WSL — cross-filesystem writes from WSL into `AppData` are frequently permission-denied):
   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:APPDATA\Claude"
   Copy-Item "\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\<user>\NeuralReaper\claude_desktop_config.json" "$env:APPDATA\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json"
   ```
5. **Docker Desktop must be running** before Claude Desktop launches the container — Claude calls `docker.exe` directly, and if the daemon isn't up yet you'll see `failed to connect to the docker API at npipe:////./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine`.
6. Fully quit and reopen Claude Desktop (system tray → Quit, not just close-the-window).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Verifying the install</strong></summary>

```bash
bash tests/smoke_test.sh
```

Or check directly inside Claude Desktop: **Settings → Developer → Local MCP servers**. NeuralReaper should show a `running` badge. If it shows `failed`, click **View Logs** — the error is almost always either "Docker Desktop isn't running" or a stale `docker` path in the config.

</details>

## Usage Examples

```
"Update Nuclei templates, then run a full CVE scan on 192.168.1.10"
"Check my lab DC against the curated CVE watchlist, then check its TLS for post-quantum readiness"
"Run certipy_find against my lab domain, then check for kerberoastable accounts"
"Run a full_recon on target.local and tell me what to prioritize testing"
"Audit this container's hardening with lynis, then run chkrootkit"
"Check 192.168.1.50 for ransomware-relevant exposure, then generate a report of everything we've found this session"
```

Sample tail of a real `nuclei_scan` run:

```
=== NUCLEI SCAN: http://192.168.56.10 [severity=critical,high,medium] ===
[CVE-2026-41940] [http] [critical] Apache HTTP Server path traversal — 192.168.56.10
[exposed-panel:phpmyadmin] [http] [medium] phpMyAdmin panel exposed — 192.168.56.10/pma/
[tech-detect:nginx] [http] [info] nginx 1.24.0 detected
```

Sample `pqc_readiness_check` output:

```
=== PQC / HNDL READINESS: target.local:443 ===
HNDL Risk Level: HIGH (classical-only key exchange — prioritize for PQ migration if data sensitivity/longevity is high)

- [HNDL RISK] No post-quantum hybrid key exchange group detected. Traffic captured today could be
  decrypted retroactively once a sufficiently large quantum computer exists.
- [CLASSICAL] RSA key exchange/signature present — broken by Shor's algorithm on a sufficiently
  large quantum computer. Long-lived sensitive data is the highest-priority migration candidate.
```

## Security & Safety Design

This is a security tool, so it's held to its own standard:

- **Non-root execution.** The container runs as an unprivileged `pentester` user; only `nmap` and `masscan` get the specific `CAP_NET_RAW` / `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capabilities they need via `setcap` — nothing runs `--privileged`.
- **Input sanitization.** Every target string is validated against a strict allow-list pattern before it touches a subprocess call; nothing is passed through a shell, so there's no string-concatenation injection surface.
- **Hard timeouts.** Every tool call is bounded (`MAX_TOOL_RUNTIME`, default 180s) so a hung scan can't hang the MCP session indefinitely.
- **No persistent listener.** The container is spawned per-session over stdio and torn down with `--rm` — there's no exposed port or standing service to leave open by accident.
- **Stateless between runs.** No scan history, credentials, or target lists are written to disk inside the container.

Known limitation: `--network host` is a native-Linux Docker feature. On Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) it runs inside a managed VM, so host-network-dependent scans (e.g. raw ARP discovery) behave correctly on Linux hosts but may need bridge-network + port-mapping adjustments on Windows/macOS — tracked in [Roadmap](#roadmap).

## Engineering Notes — Real Problems Solved

Authentic build log, kept here deliberately instead of polished away — this is the part that's actually interesting in an interview.

| Problem | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `apt-get install` failed on `gcc-16`/`libexpat1` with 404s | Kali **rolling** repo had a transient broken dependency chain at build time (`libgcc-15-dev` requiring an unavailable `libtsan2` version) | Migrated base image from `kalilinux/kali-rolling` to `ubuntu:24.04`; replaced Kali-only packages (`wpscan`, `ffuf`, `exploitdb`) with `gem install`, a pinned GitHub binary release, and a direct GitLab clone respectively |
| `wpscan` / `ffuf` not found via `apt-get` | Not Ubuntu-packaged | `gem install wpscan` (it's a Ruby gem); `ffuf` pulled as a prebuilt release binary |
| `docker: command not found` inside WSL2 despite Docker Desktop running | Docker Desktop's **WSL Integration** toggle was off for that specific distro | Settings → Resources → WSL Integration → enable the distro → Apply & Restart |
| `mkdir: Permission denied` writing to `/mnt/c/Users/.../AppData/Roaming/Claude` from WSL2 | Cross-filesystem writes from WSL2 into Windows `AppData` hit Windows ACL restrictions even as root inside WSL2 | Did the copy from native **PowerShell** instead, reading the WSL2 file via the `\\wsl.localhost\` UNC path |
| Tool never appeared in Claude's tool list at all | Claude was running as the **Microsoft Store** package (`...\WindowsApps\Claude_...`), which is sandboxed and never reads `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` | Uninstalled the Store package, installed the direct `.exe` from claude.ai/download instead |
| MCP server showed `failed` — `Server disconnected` | Logs showed `failed to connect to the docker API at npipe:////./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine` | Docker Desktop simply wasn't running yet when Claude Desktop tried to spawn the container — config and image were already correct |

The takeaway that mattered most: **read the actual log file before changing anything.** Every fix above came from `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-NeuralReaper.log`, not guesswork.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Native bridge-network mode with explicit port mapping for Windows/macOS Docker Desktop
- [ ] Structured JSON output mode per tool (for downstream parsing instead of raw text)
- [x] ~~Session report generator that aggregates a full engagement into a single Markdown document~~ — shipped as `generate_report`
- [ ] PDF export option for `generate_report` (currently Markdown only)
- [ ] CI pipeline that builds the image and runs `tests/smoke_test.sh` on every push
- [ ] PingCastle integration — currently skipped; it's a .NET/Windows-only tool meant to run on a domain-joined host, not from a Linux container against a remote target. Best used as a separate, complementary tool rather than forced into this container via Wine/Mono.
- [ ] Autonomous PoV generation (à la FuzzingBrain/Revelio) — a genuinely research-grade capability. `fuzz_binary` gives the practical building block (crash discovery via AFL++); full automated hypothesis-generation-and-verification on arbitrary codebases is a much larger system and isn't implemented here. Listed honestly as a stretch goal, not oversold as already working.

## Contributing

Adding a new tool wrapper is intentionally mechanical — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the exact constraints (Claude Desktop's MCP gateway is picky about type hints and docstrings) before opening a PR.
